- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jeremiah Pechin
- 👀 I’m interested in pursuing opportunities as a Product Owner. I'm not really a developer, more of a requirements guy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning disc golfing, karate, how to be an adequate father, product management and ownership.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on agile methodology, projects, etc. Let me know how I can help.
- 📫 How to reach me: jlpechin@yahoo.com
